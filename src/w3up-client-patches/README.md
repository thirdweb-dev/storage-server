# What is this?

w3up-client-patches is a directory containing patches to the w3up-client.

This was done to avoid forking the w3up-client and publishing a new package.

To stay true to the original PR that added the patches, the patches are
not ported to TypeScript.

The patches are based on this PR: https://github.com/web3-storage/w3up/pull/745/files#diff-17b222fad3891775b8300148075e6160def3a892b805776cf1ec51a9f02d60d6R194
